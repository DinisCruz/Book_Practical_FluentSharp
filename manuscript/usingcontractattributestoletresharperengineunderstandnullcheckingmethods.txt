##  Using ContractAttributes to let ReSharper engine understand null checking methods 

One of my favorite Extension Methods in [FluentSharp](http://nuget.org/packages?q=fluentSharp) is the .**_isNull() _**which will return null if the object it is used on is null.

The problem is that ReSharper's analysis engine doesn't understand it, so we would get an error/warning like this:

Which is obviously not correct, since **_aString.isNull()_** will return true in this case.

To deal with this, I added a couple JetBrains **_ContractAnnotation _**to those Extension Methods:

And now ReSharper's engine will detect that those code paths (that previously flagged the null exception) will never be taken:

Note that I also added Contract Annotations to the **_isFalse_** and **_isTrue _**extension methods

The only annoying thing is that it seems that the **_ContractAnnotation_** class needs to be in the JetBrains.Annotations namespace, which I didn't really want to include in the FluentSharp.CoreLib.dll (I'm sure there is a a workaround, which I'll find later)
