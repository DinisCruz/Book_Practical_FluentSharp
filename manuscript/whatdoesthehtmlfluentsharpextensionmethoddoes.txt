##  What does the .html() FluentSharp Extension Method does 

Well it gets the HTML code of a particular URL :)

And it does the same thing as the [FluentSharp BCL](http://nuget.org/packages/FluentSharp.BCL/)'s  **_.GET() _**extension method.

Here is a script that shows both in action:  

    
    var topPanel     = panel.clear().add_Panel();  
    var codeViewer1  = topPanel.add_SourceCodeViewer();  
    var codeViewer2  = codeViewer1.insert_Right().add_SourceCodeViewer();

var url = "http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js";  
var htmlCode = url.html();  
var getCode = url.GET();

codeViewer1.set_Text(htmlCode);  
codeViewer2.set_Text(getCode);

return htmlCode == getCode;  
  
This script (using the [O2 Platform](http://blog.diniscruz.com/p/owasp-o2-platform.html)'s [C# REPL](http://blog.diniscruz.com/p/c-repl-script-environment.html)) will create two source code viewers (side by side) and will show the content's of both **_.html()_** and .**_GET()_** inside it, the return value confirms that they are the same:

Interestingly, google.co.uk's response is unique (note the return value):
