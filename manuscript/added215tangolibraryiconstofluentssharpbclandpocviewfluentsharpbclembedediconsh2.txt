##  Added 215 Tango Library Icons to FluentsSharp.BCL and 'PoC - View FluentSharp_BCL Embeded Icons.h2' 

I just added to [FluentSharp.BCL](https://nuget.org/packages/FluentSharp.BCL) 229 icons from [http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library) which should help the O2 Scripts/Tools to look more professional and slick.

The icons where added to the resources (*.rex) file **FormImages **and can be consumed easily via FluentSharp.BCL's extensions methods (see script below for an example of using it on a ToolStrip control)

To  help to find an icon to use, I wrote a quick icon viewer which looks like this:
