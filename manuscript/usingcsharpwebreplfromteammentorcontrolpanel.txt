##  Using CSharp Web REPL from TeamMentor Control Panel 

I needed to do some live debugging on TeamMentor, so I just added a simpler version of the [CSharp-REPL Web](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2012/10/web-based-c-repl-key-milestone-in-o2s.html) to it.

To access it, go to the TeamMentor's Control Panel, and click on the **_C# REPL_** link:

which should look like this:

What is really powerful is that we have full access to the live HttpContext and (for example) the HttpRequest objects:

And if you are running TeamMentor locally (i.e. from Cassini) you can also open an O2 **_Script_Me_** C# REPL window like this:  

    
    HttpContext.Current.script_Me();
    
    return 12;
    
    //using System.Web;

//O2Ref:FluentSharp.BCL.dll  
//O2Ref:FluentSharp.REPL.exe  
//O2Ref:O2_Platform_External_SharpDevelop.dll  


Which will give you a much more flexible and powerful way to script the ASP.NET Http pipeline:
