##  Version of O2Platform 5.3 released 

I just pushed to GitHub a new version of the O2 Platform which has a massive Namespace rename and a number of new features  


  


You can download the stand-alone exe from here: [https://o2platform.googlecode.com/files/O2%20Platform%20-%20Main%20O2%20Gui%20v5.3.exe](https://o2platform.googlecode.com/files/O2%20Platform%20-%20Main%20O2%20Gui%20v5.3.exe)

  


The NuGet packages can be consumed from [http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=fluentSharp](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=fluentSharp) 

  


And the code is at [https://github.com/o2platform](https://github.com/o2platform)  (with for example the FluentSharp commits available at: [https://github.com/o2platform/FluentSharp/commits/master](https://github.com/o2platform/FluentSharp/commits/master) )

  


Let me know your views on it or if you find probs running it

  


Thanks
